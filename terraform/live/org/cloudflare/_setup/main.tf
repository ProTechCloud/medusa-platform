# The two long-lived Cloudflare tokens, created here rather than clicked in a
# dashboard.
#
# Account-owned, not user-owned. `cloudflare_account_token` and
# `/accounts/{id}/tokens` belong to the Cloudflare account; `cloudflare_api_token`
# and `/user/tokens` belong to a person, and a person leaving takes CI with
# them. Account tokens are also what Cloudflare documents for automation.
#
# That choice is also what makes the mint token expressible here at all. The
# user API refuses to let one token create another that manages tokens —
# `{"code":1001,"message":"sub-token is not allowed to have permissions to
# manage other tokens"}` — because every user token is a sub-token of a person.
# An account token managing account tokens is not that relationship.
#
# This is the one root that belongs in `_setup` on the Cloudflare side: CI
# cannot run at all without these, and a person applies it holding a bootstrap
# account token whose only permission is `Account API Tokens Write`.
#
# The point is not that a hand-made secret is untidy. It is that a token's
# policy is the security boundary, and a policy clicked in a dashboard is
# reviewed by nobody. Everything else in this repository makes permission
# readable in a diff.
#
# Both values land in this root's state. `org/cloudflare/setup` lives in the
# management bucket, and the IAM condition in org/gcp/_setup limits the
# Cloudflare CI identities to `org/cloudflare/live/`, so only the bootstrap
# admin can read this prefix. The README lists both as secrets that reach
# state, as the standard asks.

# Permission groups are addressed by UUID, and the UUIDs are not stable to
# paste from a tutorial. They are looked up by name, and an exact-name match is
# taken from the result: the API's name filter is a search, so asking for
# "Zone Read" can also return "Zone Settings Read".
#
# `one()` is load-bearing. A name that matches nothing, or matches twice, stops
# the apply — rather than producing a token whose policy silently grants less
# than it reads as granting.

# The names go in raw, despite the provider documentation saying the value must
# be URL-encoded. The provider encodes them itself, so passing urlencode()
# output double-encodes: a space becomes `+`, the `+` becomes `%2B`, and the
# API is asked for the literal string "Zone+Settings+Read".
#
# That failed silently rather than loudly — a filter it cannot match is
# ignored, the full list comes back, and the exact-name filter below picked the
# right one anyway. Correct by accident is still worth fixing: the filter is
# what keeps this from depending on a 1000-item default page size.

# ---------- the plan token ----------
# Read-only, and a repository secret rather than an environment one: plans run
# on pull-request code, and `uses: ./…` resolves from the pull request's own
# branch, so any secret a plan job holds is reachable by a workflow an
# unreviewed branch can rewrite. The worst a leak buys here is reading records
# that are already public.
#
# The read groups mirror the write groups the apply job mints for itself, so
# the two stay comparable when either changes.

# ---------- the mint token is not here ----------
# Two attempts, both refused, both with a credential created in the dashboard
# and carrying the permission the call needs:
#
#   POST /client/v4/user/tokens                  → 400, code 1001
#     caller: user token with `API Tokens Write`
#   POST /client/v4/accounts/{account_id}/tokens → 400, code 1001
#     caller: account token with `Account API Tokens Write`
#
#   {"message":"sub-token is not allowed to have permissions to manage other tokens"}
#
# The same refusal on both APIs rules out this being a user-versus-account
# distinction. And because both callers were made in the dashboard rather than
# by another token, "sub-token" has to mean the token being created, not the
# one creating it: what is refused is a token minted through the API holding
# token-management permission.
#
# Stated at the confidence it has: Cloudflare documents no such rule, and this
# is two observations plus one matching report from outside this project. What
# has not been tried is a narrower resource scope than the whole account, or a
# different permission group. If someone finds a shape that works, the mint
# token belongs here beside the plan token.
#
# Until then it is made by hand, from the Create Additional Tokens template
# under Manage Account → API Tokens, and its policy is the one Cloudflare
# permission in this repository that code cannot express. Keep it separate from
# the bootstrap token even though the policy is identical: one lives in CI and
# one lives with a person, and they are rotated for different reasons.

# A user-owned plan token existed here briefly, before this root moved to
# account tokens. It cannot be destroyed from here: the provider reaches a user
# token through /user/tokens, and an account token is refused there with "Valid
# user-level authentication not found". Terraform could neither refresh it nor
# delete it, so the apply stopped on the refresh.
#
# It was dropped from state with `terraform state rm cloudflare_api_token.plan`
# and revoked by hand under My Profile → API Tokens. Written down because the
# state is the only record that it ever existed, and that record is now gone.

# The zone settings this root used to own moved to org/cloudflare, so they go
# through plan, review and apply.
#
# `removed` with `destroy = false` rather than deleting the resource block:
# deleting it would make Terraform destroy the settings, and destroying a
# cloudflare_zone_setting does not remove anything, it resets that setting to
# Cloudflare's default. `ssl` would drop from strict to flexible on a live
# zone, between this apply and the next one.
