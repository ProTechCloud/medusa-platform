# The identity the VM runs as is created here, not in the workload root.

# It was in the workload root, which forced the apply spoke to hold
# serviceAccountAdmin. That role cannot be narrowed: IAM conditions can only
# read resource.name for services that publish it, and iam.googleapis.com does
# not. A condition naming medusa-${var.environment}-vm therefore evaluates
# false and grants nothing, while an unconditioned grant would let the apply
# identity edit every service account in the project, its own spokes included.
#
# Creating it alongside the spokes removes the dilemma: the apply identity
# never needs to create a service account, so it never needs the role.
