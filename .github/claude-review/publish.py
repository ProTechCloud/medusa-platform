"""Carries out the reconciled Claude review on the pull request.

Run by .github/workflows/claude-code-review.yml, taken from the base branch like the rules. Two
Claude steps came before it, kept apart on purpose:

1. the review, blind to earlier comments, returned every finding present at the head commit;
2. the reconcile step matched those findings to this workflow's threads by meaning, and chose an
   action for each thread: keep, resolve or reopen, with an optional reply.

This script writes, and holds both to hard rules whatever they said:

- only this workflow's own threads are replied to, resolved or reopened;
- a thread a person resolved is never reopened; only an open one is resolved;
- a finding the reconcile step matched is never posted; every other one is, all in one review,
  except one on the exact line of a thread that stays open, sharing a lens with it;
- a finding on a line the diff does not carry moves to the nearest one it does;
- the verdict follows the threads: changes are requested while any thread of this workflow is
  open, and approved, after its earlier requests for changes are dismissed, when none is. An
  unchanged request for changes is edited in place; an older verdict is dismissed and collapsed.

Prints `open=<n>` to $GITHUB_OUTPUT for the step that holds the check red.
